<p>I'm an IT Professional with a primary focus on offensive & application security engineering. I have been involved in hacking & security since 2009 and have been working in the IT industry professionally for the past 7 years. I have spoken about security topics as a keynote speaker & educator since 2013 and have provided practical cybersecurity online courses, training seminars, and workshops. I am skilled in PHP programming and web development since 2011, as well as database management and GNU/Linux system administration.</p>

<p>Currently, I am building an Application Security (AppSec) program at the Batam Indonesia Free Zone Authority (BIFZA) as part of the software development process and assisting with penetration testing across all of our external surfaces, including actively monitoring digital assets. In my free time, I have helped identify and exploit security vulnerabilities in various global companies and organizations such as Cisco, Salesforce, Gojek, PUBG, ABB, MTN Group, government sites, and more.</p>
